### Realistic Pinball Physics Integration

#### Enhanced Ball Properties
```typescript
// Authentic pinball specifications
const ball = this.physicsEngine.createObject({
  radius: 14, // Slightly larger for substantial feel (real: 1 1/16")
  mass: 6, // Heavy steel ball (6x heavier than generic ball)
  restitution: 0.65, // Moderate bounce like real pinball
  friction: 0.18, // Steel on metal/plastic surface friction
})

// Stronger gravity for realistic weight feel
this.physicsEngine.setGravity(0, 520) // Up from 400
```

#### Web Audio API Sound System

#### Procedural Audio Generation
```typescript
// No external audio files - all sounds generated mathematically
createBounceSound() {
  // Metallic ping with harmonics for realistic pinball sound
  const fundamental = Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * 800 * t) * 0.5
  const harmonic2 = Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * 1600 * t) * 0.3
  const harmonic3 = Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * 2400 * t) * 0.2
  const noise = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1 // Realistic texture
  
  return (fundamental + harmonic2 + harmonic3 + noise) * envelope
}

// Velocity-responsive audio feedback
playBounceSound(velocity) {
  const normalizedVelocity = Math.min(velocity / 500, 1.0)
  const volume = 0.3 + normalizedVelocity * 0.7
  const pitch = 0.8 + normalizedVelocity * 0.4
}
```

---

## Latest Development Updates - Version 1.1.0 ðŸŽµ DRAMATIC AUDIO-REACTIVE TITLE & UI POLISH

### Phase 13: Audio-Reactive Main Title & Attract Mode Update âœ… COMPLETE

#### Main Menu & Attract Mode Title
- **Audio-Reactive Main Title**: The main menu and attract mode now feature a neon "CIRCUIT BREAKER" title that pulses and glows in sync with the music. The effect is dramatically obvious, with the stroke width and opacity ramping up on musical beats and fading out during quiet moments.
- **Threshold Ramp**: The title's stroke is invisible for low audio levels, then ramps up rapidly for a bold, beat-synced effect.
- **Attract Mode Title**: Attract mode now displays the main "CIRCUIT BREAKER" title at the top of the screen, using the same audio-reactive effect as the main menu for brand consistency.
- **Visual Consistency**: Both screens use Electric Blue for the stroke and Neon Purple for the fill, with no color transition to pink.

#### UI & Visual Polish
- **Subtitle & Menu Polish**: Subtitle and menu elements updated for improved neon glow and visual hierarchy.
- **Bug Fixes & Linting**: All recent UI and animation changes maintain zero linter errors and high code quality.

#### Technical Implementation Details
```typescript
// Audio-reactive title stroke width ramp
let strokeWidth = 0;
if (pulseIntensity > 0.40) {
  const rampProgress = (pulseIntensity - 0.40) / (1.0 - 0.25);
  strokeWidth = rampProgress * 12;
}
ctx.lineWidth = strokeWidth;
ctx.strokeStyle = `rgba(0, 240, 255, ${pulseIntensity})`;
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### Advanced Physics System
```typescript
// Realistic pinball physics with heavy steel ball
const ball = this.physicsEngine.createObject({
  mass: 6, // Heavy steel ball (6x heavier than generic)
  restitution: 0.65, // Moderate bounce like real pinball
  friction: 0.18, // Steel on metal/plastic surface friction
  radius: 14 // Authentic pinball size
})

// Intelligent collision response with audio
if (velocityAlongNormal < -0.5) {
    applyBouncePhysics(ball, restitution);
    playBounceSound(collisionVelocity); // Velocity-based audio
} else {
    applyRollingPhysics(ball, gravityAlongSlope);
}
```

### Web Audio API Sound System
```typescript
// Procedural sound generation - no external files needed
createBounceSound() {
  // Metallic ping with harmonics
  const fundamental = Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * 800 * t) * 0.5
  const harmonic2 = Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * 1600 * t) * 0.3
  const harmonic3 = Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * 2400 * t) * 0.2
  return (fundamental + harmonic2 + harmonic3) * envelope
}

// Velocity-responsive audio feedback
playBounceSound(velocity) {
  const volume = 0.3 + normalizedVelocity * 0.7
  const pitch = 0.8 + normalizedVelocity * 0.4
}

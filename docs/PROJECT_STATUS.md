## 🔧 TECHNICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### Advanced Physics System
```typescript
// Realistic rolling physics implementation
const gravityAlongSlope = gravity * Math.sin(barAngle);
const rollingResistance = 0.01;
const surfaceFriction = 0.05;

// Intelligent collision response
if (velocityAlongNormal < -0.5) {
    // High-speed collision: bounce with energy loss
    applyBouncePhysics(ball, restitution);
} else {
    // Gentle contact: realistic rolling
    applyRollingPhysics(ball, gravityAlongSlope);
}
```

### Performance Breakthrough

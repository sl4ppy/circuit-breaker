# Circuit Breaker

## Project Overview

**Circuit Breaker** is a modern digital arcade game that reimagines the classic Ice Cold Beer arcade mechanics with a neon cyberpunk aesthetic. Players guide a glowing data packet through a vertical circuit board using a tilting bar, avoiding electrical hazards while delivering data to illuminated target ports.

## Game Concept & Elevator Pitch

**"Navigate the digital frontier in Circuit Breaker - where every pixel pulses with neon energy and every move could fry your data packet. Master the art of precision tilting as you guide glowing data through a maze of live electrical nodes. Can you become the ultimate circuit runner?"**

### Core Mechanics
- **Tilting Bar Control**: Independent left/right bar movement for precise packet navigation

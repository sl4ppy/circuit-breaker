## Core Game Loop

### Primary Objective
Guide a glowing data packet from the bottom of a vertical circuit board to an illuminated target port at the top, avoiding all live electrical nodes (holes) along the way.

### Game Flow
1. **Level Start**: Data packet spawns at bottom center of circuit board
2. **Navigation**: Player tilts bar to roll packet left/right and upward
3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Navigate around electrical nodes and hazards
4. **Target Acquisition**: Reach illuminated port to complete level
5. **Progression**: Unlock next level with increased difficulty
6. **Failure Recovery**: Restart current level if packet falls through nodes

## Win/Lose Conditions

### Victory Conditions
- **Level Complete**: Data packet successfully reaches illuminated target port
- **Progression**: Unlock next level with new target location
- **Achievement**: Complete all levels to "beat the game"

### Failure Conditions
- **Packet Destruction**: Data packet falls through any electrical node (hole)
- **Time Limit**: Optional time pressure on higher difficulty levels
- **Bar Overload**: Excessive tilting causes system failure (advanced mechanic)

### Recovery Mechanics
- **Immediate Restart**: Level resets instantly upon failure
- **No Lives System**: Infinite attempts encourage experimentation
- **Quick Reset**: Single button press to restart current level

## Controls

### Primary Input Methods
- **Keyboard**: Arrow keys or WASD for bar tilting
- **Mouse**: Click and drag for direct bar manipulation
- **Touch**: Swipe gestures for mobile compatibility
- **Gamepad**: Analog stick support for console-style play

### Control Mapping
```
Left Tilt:  A, Left Arrow, or Left Mouse/Touch
Right Tilt: D, Right Arrow, or Right Mouse/Touch
Reset Level: R, Space, or Reset Button
Pause:      Escape or Pause Button
```

### Bar Mechanics
- **Independent Control**: Left and right sides of bar can tilt separately
- **Smooth Movement**: Gradual tilting with momentum and physics
- **Responsive Input**: Immediate response to player commands
- **Visual Feedback**: Bar position clearly visible and intuitive

## Physics Behavior

### Data Packet Physics
- **Gravity**: Constant downward force when not supported
- **Momentum**: Packet maintains velocity when rolling
- **Bounce**: Realistic collision response with bar and walls
- **Friction**: Gradual slowdown on bar surface
- **Air Resistance**: Minimal drag when falling

### Bar Physics
- **Tilt Limits**: Maximum 45-degree angle on each side
- **Smooth Rotation**: Gradual movement with easing
- **Collision Detection**: Precise packet-bar interaction
- **Stability**: Bar returns to level when no input

### Environmental Physics
- **Wall Collisions**: Packet bounces off circuit board boundaries
- **Node Hazards**: Instant destruction when packet enters holes
- **Target Ports**: Magnetic attraction when packet is close
- **Special Zones**: Speed boost areas, teleporters, or barriers

## Level Progression

### Difficulty Curve
1. **Level 1-3**: Basic navigation with few obstacles
2. **Level 4-6**: Introduction of moving hazards
3. **Level 7-10**: Complex pathfinding with multiple targets
4. **Level 11+**: Expert challenges with time pressure

### Level Design Principles
- **Clear Path**: Always provide a viable route to target
- **Progressive Complexity**: Introduce one new element per level
- **Visual Clarity**: Hazards and targets are easily distinguishable
- **Fair Challenge**: Difficulty increases gradually, not suddenly

### Level Elements
- **Static Nodes**: Fixed electrical hazards
- **Animated Nodes**: Dynamic holes that appear/disappear with spring animation
- **Moving Hazards**: Rotating or sliding obstacles
- **Multiple Targets**: Choose between different ports
- **Time Pressure**: Countdown timers for urgency
- **Special Mechanics**: Teleporters, speed zones, barriers

### Dynamic Animated Holes (v1.0.0)
- **Appearance**: Holes spring into view with smooth overshoot animation
- **Timing**: 1-second animation in, 3-10 seconds active, 1-second animation out, 2-5 seconds hidden
- **Positioning**: Only appear in top half of playfield for balanced difficulty
- **Scaling**: 2-3 holes in early levels, increasing with level progression
- **Collision**: Only active for collision when fully visible, creating dynamic obstacle patterns

## Failure Modes

### Common Failure Scenarios
1. **Overcorrection**: Player tilts too aggressively and loses control
2. **Momentum Issues**: Packet gains too much speed and overshoots
3. **Path Planning**: Poor route selection leads to dead ends
4. **Timing Errors**: Misjudging when to change direction
5. **Physics Misunderstanding**: Not accounting for bounce and momentum

### Learning Opportunities
- **Immediate Feedback**: Clear visual and audio cues for failures
- **Tutorial Levels**: Gradual introduction of mechanics
- **Practice Mode**: Sandbox environment for experimentation
- **Hint System**: Optional guidance for stuck players

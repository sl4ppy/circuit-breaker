# Circuit Breaker - Robust Physics System

## Overview

Circuit Breaker now uses a highly robust and accurate physics system based on **Verlet Integration** with **constraint solving** and **impulse-based collision resolution**. This system provides stable, accurate physics simulation suitable for intensive physics-based gameplay.

## Key Features

### 1. Verlet Integration
- **Stable Integration**: Uses Verlet integration instead of Euler integration for better stability
- **Energy Conservation**: Maintains better energy conservation over time
- **No Velocity Accumulation**: Reduces numerical drift and instability
- **Position-Based**: Directly integrates positions, calculating velocities from position changes

### 2. Constraint Solving
- **Distance Constraints**: Maintain fixed distances between objects (springs, rods)
- **Position Constraints**: Pin objects to specific positions (anchors)
- **Angle Constraints**: Maintain angles between objects (planned)
- **Iterative Solver**: Multiple constraint iterations per frame for accuracy

### 3. Advanced Collision Detection
- **Continuous Collision Detection**: Prevents tunneling through fast-moving objects
- **Collision Manifolds**: Detailed collision information including contact points and normals
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Efficient broad-phase collision detection using spatial grids
- **Impulse-Based Resolution**: Accurate collision response with proper mass consideration

### 4. Fixed Timestep Simulation
- **Deterministic Physics**: Fixed timestep ensures consistent behavior across different framerates
- **Substeps**: Multiple physics substeps per frame for increased accuracy
- **Time Accumulation**: Handles variable framerate gracefully

### 5. Per-Object Properties
- **Mass**: Affects collision response and constraint solving
- **Restitution**: Bounciness (0-1)
- **Friction**: Surface friction for realistic interactions
- **Individual Settings**: Each object can have unique physical properties

## Physics Engine Architecture

### Core Components

```typescript

## Performance Optimizations

### Spatial Partitioning

- **Efficient Queries**: Only checks nearby objects for collisions
- **Dynamic Updates**: Grid updates as objects move

### Substeps
- **4 Substeps**: Each frame divided into 4 physics substeps
- **Smaller Timesteps**: Increases accuracy without reducing performance

physicsEngine.setAirResistance(0.999)

// Simulation bounds
physicsEngine.setBounds(360, 640)

// Constraint iterations
constraintIterations = 3

// Substeps per frame
substeps = 4
```

### Per-Object Settings
```typescript
const ball = physicsEngine.createObject({
  id: 'ball',
  x: 100, y: 100,
  radius: 12,
  mass: 1,
  restitution: 0.8,  // Bounciness
  friction: 0.2,     // Surface friction
  isStatic: false
})
```

## Constraint System

### Distance Constraints
Maintain fixed distances between objects:
```typescript
physicsEngine.addConstraint({
  type: 'distance',
  objectA: ball1,
  objectB: ball2,
  targetDistance: 50,
  stiffness: 0.8
})
```

### Position Constraints
Pin objects to specific positions:
```typescript
physicsEngine.addConstraint({
  type: 'position',
  objectA: ball,
  targetPosition: { x: 300, y: 200 },
  stiffness: 0.1
})
```
